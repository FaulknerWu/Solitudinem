# Solitudinem

*My English is not very good, please forgive my poor translation*

## Basic introduction



1. I inherited this modpack from my friend because she is very busy studying.
2. The name is derived from Latin: Solitudinem, but I don't understand Latin at all. I guess the original author probably wanted to take the English meaning of Solitude when naming it.
3. The author aims to achieve the complexity and diversity of the recipes through the multiple worktables of Artisan Worktables and the material system of CoT.
