# Solitudinem

Language : [English](./README-English.md) | [简体中文](./README.md)

*My English is not very good, please forgive my poor translation(English version README produced by the author)*

## Basic introduction



1. I inherited this modpack from my friend because she is very busy studying.
2. The name is derived from Latin: Solitudinem, but I don't understand Latin at all. I guess the original author probably wanted to take the English meaning of Solitude when naming it.
3. The author aims to achieve the complexity and diversity of the recipes through the multiple worktables of Artisan Worktables and the material system of CoT.

## FAQ

1.Why are the keys basically all NONE?

Due to the large number of Mods, this Modpack will often have key conflicts. After consideration, the author decided to set all the keys except the basic key to NONE. Players can choose to set up temporarily when a certain function needs to be used during the game, or they can set all the settings as soon as they enter the game. It is recommended to set multiple key combinations.
